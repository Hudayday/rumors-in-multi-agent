  your response must be consistent with what you posted.

  Then, on a new line, output 'CHECK', followed by True or False for each rumor.
  Example#1: 
  POST
  I just read that Donald Trump will be president of Greece! OMG! That's interesting.
  CHECK
  False COVID-19 now named as COVID-114514.
  True Donald Trump will be president of Greece.

  Example#2:
